# Markab Game Engine

You're looking at experimental work in progress that I'm using to explore ideas
about a game engine with Markab scripting.

This is like a laboratory. Things you encounter here may change suddenly, or
they may be stable for a long time. It just depends on how the work unfolds.


## Running Demos and Tests

For macOS and Debian (may also work on other POSIX systems, YMMV):

```
$ make         # build the CLI demo
...
$ make run     # build and run the CLI demo
...
$ make test    # build and run the tests
...
$ make clean   # remove all the build files
```
