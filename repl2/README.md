# Repl2

You're looking at experimental work in progress that I'm using to explore ideas
about how markabForth should behave.

This is like a laboratory. Things you encounter here may change suddenly, or
they may be stable for a long time. It just depends on how the work unfolds.

For an explanation of what repl2 is about, see my dev journal entry for
[2022-06-04](https://samblenny.github.io/markab-dev-journal/day/2022-06-04.html)
